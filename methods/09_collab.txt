Aim: Array traversal


/**Collaboration:
* students will use the Think-Pair-Share strategy. Be sure to *make use of the rubber duck strategy during the THINK-Phase 
*if stuck.
*Either the teacher or students who are finished
* will provide assistance as requested.
*/


Mini-Lesson Plan
/** Get in your assignment groups.
* Use Think- Pair-Strategy to work on the first question.
* Be sure to place appropriate comments in your code.
* Confirm your answer by running your code
*/

// WARM -UP:
* Teacher models Think-Pair-Share
* Prompts:
   * Identity each part of the method
      * method header
      * code blocks
   * Write down your commnetns as you trace the code
   * What does this method accomplish?
   * Use a table to trace the code? 
       * Hint: Use int [] aRay = {7,2,9,2,1};
   * Share your results with your partner.
   * Run your code in Replit. How does your anwer compare 
       with Replit?
   * Be prepared to share with class.

public static void print(int [] aRay)
{  
  // Place comments here
   int index =0 ;

  // Place comments here
  while( index < aRay.length)
  {  
     // Place comments here
     System.out.print( aRay[index]);
     
     // Place comments here
     index++;

  } // end of loop
}// end of method


/** Activity:
** Continue to solve each problem below in your groups using *the Think-Pair-Share  and Rubber Duck strategies.
* be sure to let me know if/when you are stuck.
*/


/**Student Task:
** Solve each problem below
*/

public static void print( int [] aRay)
{  int index =0 ;
  // place for loop here

      // print statement here
  
}//end of method


public static void print( int [] aRay)
{  int index =0 ;
  // place for each loop here

      // print statement here
  
}// end of method

Write two methods to print out the values of an array of doubles in reverse order. Use two different type of loops.

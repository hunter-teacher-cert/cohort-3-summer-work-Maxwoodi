**Computer Science Club**

_Club activities are designed to lead into a biannual mini hackaton competition_
  * Club is run by hosting both a Robotics club and a Coding Club in parallel
  * Club is open to all students but CS students are expected to attend

**Create a Computer Science Club that culminates with an an Biannual Hackaton**

#### How It Works

A. Provide a 3 to 5- minute talk or activity to focus students' attention of the task of the day.
  1. Short video
  2. Talk
  3. Real-life industry experience from an article in story form.
  4. Personnel: schooll staff, industry personnel, parent, former student/club member

B. Create teams of sizes 2 - 3 students.

    1.Project problem solving tasks on large viewing screen along  with verbal description of expected outcome.
    2. Students take out thier laptops and dive into problem solving.
    3. Create an environment that stimulates healthy commpetition and learning.
    4. Distribute prizes and make honorable mention.
    5. Encourage and invite the wider community(parents, staff, and potential newcomers to attend - especially on competition days).


        1. Make repeated announcements
        2. Post student-made flyers.
        3. Post results of commpetition.


C. Target Newcomers

    1. Run parallel worshops/club on:
        * Digital problem solving techniques.
        * Robotic Club.
    2. Be welcoming to newcomers.
        * Take down follow up information.
        * Be sure to hand out club-idenitfying freebies such as corsage and boutonniere - especially at competition time.
        * Make snacks available. 
        
    
 



#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* students love exploration.
* students can have fun while learning
* healthy competion is stimulating
* Emotive and social learning are great for students
* Parents can have first hand experience of their child learning on competition days.
* 

#### Rollout Timeline
* Competions will be held towards the end of each semester.
* After School sessions will be held once per week. These sessions are designed to lead up naturally to two competitions each year.
* First competiton held during CSed Week.
* Second competition held before Spring Break.
 


#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Actively seek parent/staff/school admin feedback
* Actively seek student feedback

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
*funding - seek funding from organziation outside of school.

*room - Point out the importance of CS in the student's world

*Academic school culture - Point out that students will still be learning and as a result their academics will eventually be impacted. CS is a career-ready course.The importance in advertising the CS Club during student recruitment.

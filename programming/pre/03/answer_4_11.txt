//4.11 exercise 1.

 // Part 1: What is the output of the following program
All methods are public and static. ping() is a void method that prints out a period and places the cursor on the next line.

The baffle() is another method that displays the string wug. The cursors remains on the same line. 
The ping() method is then called to output the period after wug and place the cursor on the next line. 

The overall program output is:

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.
Cursor

//Part 2: Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping() is invoked.




//Part 3
 Invoking baffle() at the end of the ping() method will display the following output.

The code would call baffle() and ping() infinitely.

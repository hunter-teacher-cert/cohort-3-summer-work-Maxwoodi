// Exercise 8.12 Question# 2 Method #1 

The banana() methods finds the product of the integer elements of array "a" and return that product.

The reference variable "a" passes the reference of the array of integers.

The integer variable "kiwi" is initialized to one and is used to store the product
of the elements to the array.

The integer variable "i" is initialized to zero. This variable is used to update the while loop

and compare the number of iterations against the length of the array of integers, "a.length"



// Exercise 8.12 Question# 2 Method #2 

The grapefruit() method searches for the presence of a specific integer in an array of integers.
The index is returned if the that integer is found. Negative one is returned otherwise. 


The array of integers is reference by "a" while "grape" represents the integer element that
 is the goal of the search.

The variable "i" is used to represent the index of each element of the array. "a.length" represents the length 
of the array.





// Exercise 8.12 Question# 2 Method #3 


The pineapple() method is used to count the number of occurences of a given integer in an array of
integers, a,  and return that count.

 

 a ---- represents the passing of the reference of an array of integers. 

"apple" ---- represents the target integer

"pine" -----represents each element in the array being counted.

"pear" is an integer counter variable initialized to store zero. It is used to store the count.
